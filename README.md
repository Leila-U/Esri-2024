## 2. Mission Statement
Group 4326 created the Urban Hub App to illustrate the complexity of urban expansion in Ontario, Canada, focusing on the distribution of the immigrant population. Our mission is to provide interactive visualizations for policymakers and urban planners to create insightful analyses to understand the challenges in rapid urbanization. 

We believe that understanding the importance of immigration patterns and their potential connection to population density, employment, and housing conditions is essential for creating inclusive and sustainable municipalities and communities. The Urban Hub App will facilitate informed decision-making, promote evidence-based policies, and inspire action towards building resilient urban cities. 

Group 4326 is driven by equity and social justice to create the Urban Hub App, which serves for a positive change in promoting evidence-based decisions, by bridging the gap between data-driven evidence and impactful decisions. We strive to create a future where urban expansion is equal for everyone.
